    <p>Hello! My name is Alexander Romero, and I am from Barranquilla, Colombia. I enjoy playing the guitar or piano.
        I love programming, and I really want to be really good at it one day. Like all good things, programming demands
         time to practice, so I am organizing my busy days to practice as needed. 
         Feel free to contact me if you wish to work with me on any assignment. Thank you for reading.

    <p>MedellÃ­n is one of the most beautiful cities in Colombia, here we have an incredible tourist destination
      in the region.
      "The landform is a granitic rock remnant that has resisted weathering and erosion, 
      likely as a result of being less fractured 
      than the surrounding bedrock. 
      The PeÃ±Ã³n de GuatapÃ© is an outcrop of the Antioquia 
      Batholith and towers up to 200 meters (656 feet) above its base. Visitors can scale the rock via a staircase
       with 708 steps built into one side" Taken from Wikipedia</p>
